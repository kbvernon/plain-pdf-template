This Quarto extension provides a very basic academic manuscript template for compiling to PDF. It borrows heavily from Andrew Heiss' [hikmah-academic-quarto](https://github.com/andrewheiss/hikmah-academic-quarto). The big difference is in the formatting. As its name suggests, the formatting of this template is just - well - plain, plain and simple. Mainly, I use it to write manuscripts to share with co-authors and others whose feedback I want or require.

## Installation

```bash
quarto install extension kbvernon/plain-pdf-template
```

## Features

- Bibliography generation with both `biblatex` and `biblatex-chicago`
- Support for Quartoâ€™s complex [author/affiliation
  schema](https://quarto.org/docs/journals/authors.html)
- Line numbers
- Watermarks

An example can be found here: [example.pdf](https://github.com/kbvernon/plain-pdf-template/blob/main/example.pdf).
